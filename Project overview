This Application Tracking System (ATS) machine learning project using Streamlit as a framework for building the interface. It integrates features like handling PDF uploads and utilizes Google Generative AI for processing inputs and generating content based on prompts. The code includes:

Handling file uploads (e.g., PDFs)
Converting PDF to images (using pdf2image and PIL)
Encoding images to Base64 format
Communicating with Google Generative AI (Gemini-1.5-flash) for generating responses based on the uploaded document and user input.
This ATS likely aims to process resumes or job applications, analyze their content, and generate outputs such as summaries or predictions about applicant fit based on the document data.
