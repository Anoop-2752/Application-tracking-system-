**This Application Tracking System (ATS) leverages machine learning and Google Generative AI to streamline the analysis of job applications, particularly resumes. It allows users to upload PDF documents, which are converted into images and encoded using Base64 for processing. The system integrates Google Generative AI (Gemini 1.5) to generate insightful responses based on the content of these documents and user prompts. Built using Streamlit for an interactive interface, this project automates key tasks in candidate screening and document analysis, enhancing efficiency in recruitment workflows.**
